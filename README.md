# Wordchain

Word chain game based on chain reaction game show.

# How to play

You will be guessinng a chain of six words that are connected by two word phrases (e.g. WDIE, OPEN, SESAME, STREET, CAR, ALARM).

You are given the first and last word in the chain, and your goal is to then guess the four words that lead the first word to the last.

You will start by getting the first letter of the second word in the chain,then you must think of a word that connects to the first in a two word phrase (e.g. SPACE SHUTTLE, SHUTTLE BUS).

If you guess correct, you will move to the next word until you reach the end.

If you guess wrong, you will receive another letter in the word to help with your guesses.
